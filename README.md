# Compatability üìÑ
I have only tested this on Arch Linux with Hyprland so testers are welcome to test it out and share their review in discussions/issues. This should work on all distros (if u tested it pls leave a comment for any issues)

Probably will work on the stuff below 
| **Category**         | **Requirements**                                                                 |

| **Desktop Environments** (might work) | GNOME, XFCE, KDE Plasma (with GTK support), LXDE/LXQT, etc.                  |
| **Window Managers**   | Hyprland (tested), Sway, i3, Openbox, Fluxbox, etc.                             |
| **Display Protocol**     | Wayland (recommended), X11 (partial functionality)                               |

# For WM users ‚ú®
make it so that `control` runs as a floating window to make it look cool if u want

hyprwm example
```
windowrulev2 = float, class:control
windowrulev2 = opacity 0.5 0.5,class:control
```
